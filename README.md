### Archimedian Spiral
- Created a WebGL animation that generates an Archimedian spiral using model-to-world and world-to-NDC transformations  
- Integrated dynamic square objects that traverse the spiral path with continuous rotation and randomized colors  
- Managed hierarchical transformations with 4Ã—4 matrix math and synchronized rendering loops for smooth motion  

### Drawing App
- Built an interactive WebGL canvas supporting freehand drawing with randomized colors  
- Implemented mouse event tracking, coordinate conversion, and real-time vertex buffer updates  
- Rendered points continuously through an optimized render loop for responsive sketching  

### Drawing Triangles
- Designed an interactive tool for placing triangles and computing bounding boxes in real time  
- Added global and per-triangle bounding boxes with automatic scaling and color differentiation  
- Used GPU buffer management and dynamic drawing modes for efficient point and box rendering  

### Rotating Squares
- Programmed dual rotating squares with separate angular velocities and independent color updates  
- Controlled transformations and shading using GLSL vertex and fragment shaders  
- Demonstrated multi-object animation through uniform variable management and sequential draw calls  

### Volcano
- Simulated a volcano eruption using WebGL particle systems and GPU-accelerated motion equations  
- Implemented ballistic and floating particles with random color variation and timed emission bursts  
- Added an interactive toggle for real-time eruption control and dynamic particle regeneration
